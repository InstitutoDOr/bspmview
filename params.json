{"name":"bspmview","tagline":"MATLAB program for viewing 3D fMRI statistical images generated by SPM","body":"### About BSPMVIEW\r\nThis is in progress documentation for using BSPMVIEW.\r\n \r\n### Installation\r\n1. Download the software\r\n2. Put the bspmview folder either on your MATLAB path or in the \"toolboxes\" subfolder of your SPM installation. Note that only the parent folder needs to be on the path. The subfolder \"supportfiles\" is added to the MATLAB path whenever you run bspmview.\r\n\r\n### Starting\r\nIf you put bspmview in the \"toolboxes\" subfolder of your SPM installation, you will be able to launch bspmview by selecting it from the \"Toolbox:\" dropdown menu in the SPM graphical user interface. Otherwise, as long as bspmview is on your MATLAB path you can start it from the command line by entering: \r\n```\r\n>> bspmview                    \r\n```\r\nThis will open a file selection dialogue window with which you can select the overlay image you'd like to display. You can also give bspmview filenames for overlay and underlay images as arguments. The following will display the overlay *spmT_0001.img* on the default underlay: \r\n```\r\n>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img') \r\n```\r\nThis will overlay \"spmT_0001.img\" on to \"T1.nii\":\r\n``` \r\n>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img', 'T1.nii')   % overlay on 'T1.nii'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changing the Appearance of the Interface\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n### Modifying Display Preferences\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n### Creating a Surface Rendering\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n### Creating a Table of Results\r\nSo...\r\n\r\n### Have Questions? \r\nFeel free to shoot me (Bob) an email at: bobspunt@gmail.com\r\n","google":"UA-56476723-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
