[Have Questions?](#have-questions)\r\n\r\n## About ##\r\n*bspmview* is a graphical user interface for overlaying, thresholding, and visualizing 3D statistical neuroimages in MATLAB. It currently requires a number of core functions from the MATLAB software [Statistical Parametric Mapping] (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), and indeed will work best with the statistical images produced using SPM. Note that it has only been tested on SPM8/SPM12. \r\n\r\n*bspmview* was directly inspired by and in some cases incorporates code from from two other statistical image viewers: [xjview](http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview8/developers/) and [FIVE](http://mrtools.mgh.harvard.edu/index.php/Main_Page). The idea behind bspmview was to integrate and improve some of the great features of these two viewing programs in an interface that I find to be more intuitive, accessible, and customizable. Most importantly, all of its features require **no additional third-party software** (other than SPM, of course). These features include: \r\n* reads .img/.hdr, .nii, and .nii.gz\r\n* can read non-statistical/non-intensity images (e.g., binary mask, ROIs, or count images)\r\n* quickly switch display of contrast sign (+, -, or +/-)\r\n* uncorrected and corrected image thresholding, including SPM-benchmarked familywise error rate (FWE) correction at both voxel and cluster levels\r\n* automatic anatomical labeling with the Anatomy Toolbox or Harvard Oxford atlases\r\n* generate interactive table of labeled activation peaks, and save (potentially) publication-ready tables to CSV \r\n* quickly generate beautiful and customizable surface renderings\r\n* save thresholded whole-brain maps or specific clusters as either intensity images or binary masks\r\n* save region-of-interest images by growing spheres/boxes around a coordinate (and optionally intersect the sphere/box with thresholded overlay image)\r\n* many colormap options\r\n* and other random features, such using [Neurosynth](http://neurosynth.org/locations/) to examine functional connectivity and coactivation maps for the current coordinate\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n1. Download the software\r\n2. Put the *bspmview* folder either on your MATLAB path or in the \"toolboxes\" subfolder of your SPM installation. Note that only the parent folder needs to be on the path. The subfolder \"supportfiles\" is added to the MATLAB path whenever you run bspmview.\r\n\r\n## Launching *bspmview*\r\nIf you put bspmview in the \"toolboxes\" subfolder of your SPM installation, you will be able to launch *bspmview* by selecting it from the \"Toolbox:\" dropdown menu in the SPM graphical user interface. Otherwise, as long as bspmview is on your MATLAB path you can start it from the command line by entering: \r\n```\r\n>> bspmview                    \r\n```\r\nThis will open a file selection dialogue window with which you can select the overlay image you'd like to display:\r\n\r\n![The File Selection Dialogue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/file_selection_2633x1083.jpg)\r\n\r\nYou can also give bspmview filenames for overlay and underlay images as arguments. The following will display the overlay *spmT_0001.img* on the default underlay (this example assumes that the image is in your working directory; otherwise, you'd need to enter the full path): \r\n```\r\n>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img') \r\n```\r\nThis will overlay *spmT_0001.img* on to *T1.nii*:\r\n``` \r\n>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img', 'T1.nii') \r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Main Interface\r\nOnce *bspmview* has launched you should see something that approximates this:\r\n\r\n![Interface Components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/gui_layout_4167x2084.jpg)\r\n\r\nExplore the interface. Click on stuff. Change values and see what happens. Try right clicking on one of the slice views and you should something like this:\r\n\r\n![AxesMenu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/AxesMenu_0376x0260.jpg)\r\n\r\nTry selecting **Save ROI at Current Location** and a menu window should pop up:\r\n                              \r\n![Save ROI Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/Save_ROI_Options_0325x0146.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhoa! Spheres AND Boxes? Customizable sizes? And what's this? I have the option to intersect my Sphere or Box with the currently displayed (i.e., thresholded) overlay!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changing the Interface Appearance\r\nIf the interface looks wonky (e.g., font sizes are too small) or if you just want to mess with the way it looks, you can do so from from the leftmost menubar entitled *bspmview*. For instance, you increase or decrease the size of the GUI window, or you can scale the font size of all text in the interface either up or down:\r\n\r\n![Change GUI and Font Size](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/change_appearance.jpg)\r\n\r\nNote the shortcut keys (called \"accelerators\" in MATLAB), which are displayed for Mac OS X here but should appear with \"Ctrl\" in place of the \"Command\" key (e.g., Ctrl=+ should increase font size).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Display:Preferences\r\nGiven that most of the *bspmview* functionality should be self-explanatory (and given that I have to get back to my real job!), I'll end the documentation for now by explaining the fields of the Display Preferences menu, which you can find under **Display** in the **Menu Bar**:\r\n\r\n![FigMenu Display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/FigMenu_Display_0250x0165.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis should bring up a menu that looks like this: \r\n\r\n![Display Preferences](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/Display_Preferences_0555x0498.jpg)\r\n\r\nThese preferences allow you to customize a number of display features included in *bspmview*. Modified preferences are saved and reloaded the next time you use *bspmview*.  Under **Thresholding** you can modify:\r\n* **Corrected Alpha**: This controls the corrected alpha to use when doing family-wise error correction\r\n\r\nUnder **Thresholding** you can also modify two parameters that control how many peaks (local maxima) are identified in the currently thresholded overlay. This will primarily affect the results tables, which display all local maxima. But it will also affect where the crosshair goes when you select **Go to Nearest Peak** from one of the slice view menus. The parameters are:\r\n* **Peak Separation**: This is the minimim distance (in mm) separating the peaks. The larger the distance, the fewer the peaks. You may know this by the *Dis variable in the SPM software. \r\n* **# Peaks/Cluster**: This is the maximum number of peaks to identify per cluster. The smaller the number, the fewer the peaks. You may know this by the *Num* variable in the SPM software. \r\n\r\nUnder **Anatomical Labeling** you can modify:\r\n* **Name**: This is the Atlas to grab the labels from (currently the Anatomy Toolbox and Harvard-Oxford are the only two preloaded into *bspmview*)\r\n\r\nUnder **Surface Rendering** you can modify parameters that control how your surface renderings will look. Most of the parameters correspond to those present in [SurfPlot](http://mrtools.mgh.harvard.edu/index.php/SurfPlot) by Aaron P. Schultz, which is the function upon which this feature is based:\r\n* **Surfaces to Render**: This controls which of the four views to show (L=Left, R=Right). For instance, the default L/R Medial/Lateral will show:\r\n\r\n                                    \r\n![Render](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spunt/bspmview/master/supportfiles/doc/Render_0745x0418.jpg)\r\n\r\n* **Surface Type**: This controls the type of surface to render on. The above was created using the *Inflated* surface option. \r\n* **Shading Type**: Set the shading information for the surface\r\n* **N Vertices**: This determines the resolution/quality of the rendering. \r\n* **Shading Min**: Set the min greyscale value for the surface underlay (range of 0 to 1)\r\n* **Shading Max**: Set the max greyscale value for the surface underlay (range of 0 to 1)\r\n* **Add Color Bar**: Option to include/exclude colorbar from rendering. \r\n* **Round Values?**: Rounds all values on the surface to nearest whole number. Useful for binary mask images.\r\n* **Nearest Neighbor?**: Only the value from the closest voxel will be used. Useful for mask and label images.\r\n* **Dilate Inclusive Mask?**: This will use *spm_dilate* to slightly dilate the suprathresholded image so that small or non-surface (e.g., sulcul) activations are visible.\r\n\r\n### Have Questions? \r\nFeel free to shoot me (Bob) an email at: bobspunt@gmail.com","google":"UA-56476723-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
